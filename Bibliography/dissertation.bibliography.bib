    derivations we will review old and recent results on the Cauchy problem, comparing 
    those obtained by IST and PDE techniques and also results more connected to the 
    physical origin of the equations. We will consider mainly the Cauchy problem on the 
    whole real line with only a few comments on the periodic case. We will also briefly 
    discuss some close relevant problems in particular the higher order extensions and 
    the two-dimensional (KP like) versions of the BO and ILW equations.",
