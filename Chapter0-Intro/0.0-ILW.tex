\section{The Intermediate Long Wave Equation}\label{sec0:ILW}


The Intermediate Long Wave (ILW) equation
\begin{align}
	u_t + \frac{1}{\delta} u_x + 2 u u_x + Tu_{xx} = 0, 
\end{align}
models the behavior of long internal gravitational waves in stratified fluid 
of depth \label{sym:delta}
$0< \delta < \infty$, \label{sym:delta}
where $T$ denotes the singular integral operator given by
\[
	(Tf)(x) 
		:= \frac{1}{2 \delta} 
			\pv \int_{\mathbb R} \coth\left( \frac{\pi}{2\delta}(y - x) \right) f(y) \, \mathrm{d}y,
\]
\label{sym0:def}and $\pv$\label{sym0:pv} denotes the Cauchy principal value, \label{sym:pv}
$\pv \int \, \mathrm{d}x = \lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0} \int_{|x|> \varepsilon}\,dx$.
In the
limit $\delta \to 0$, the ILW reduces to the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation, and under 
the limit $\delta \to \infty$, Santini, Ablowitz and Fokas showed formally in their
1984 paper \cite{Santini1984} that the ILW equation reduces to the Benjamin-Ono 
(BO) equation. As such, the 
ILW can be thought of as an intermediary between the two equations. While the KdV
equation is very well understood, understanding the BO equation is still an area
of active research.\footnote{For more on the BO equation, please see Allen Wu's papers 
\cite{Wu2016} and \cite{Wu2017}.} Given the ILW's role as an 
intermediary between the two equations, a mathematically rigorous understanding 
of the ILW is of great interest to many mathematicians.

As discussed in the 2019 survey paper \cite{Saut2019} by Jean-Claude Saut, 
the formal derivation of the ILW as a model for physical phenomenon was 
given by R. I. Joseph in \cite{Joseph_1977}. Joseph based his derivation on
the Whithan non-local equation derived by Gerald Whitham in his 1967 paper 
\cite{WhithamGB1967Ndow}. The modern form of the ILW was introduced by 
T. Kubota, D.R.S. Ko, and L.D. Dobbs in their 1978 paper \cite{Kubota1978}.
Some atmospheric and oceanic applications of the 
ILW can be found in the 1978 paper by D.R. Christie \textit{et al.} 
\cite{Christie1978}, the 1980 S.A. Maslow and L.G. Redekopp paper 
\cite{maslowe_redekopp_1980}, the 1981 C. Gary Koop and Gerald Butler paper
\cite{koop_butler_1981}, and the 1984 N.N. Romanova paper
\cite{Romanova1984}.
