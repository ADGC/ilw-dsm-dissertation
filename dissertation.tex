\abstract{
	In the early 1980's, Kodama, Ablowitz and Satsuma, together with Santini, 
	Ablowitz and Fokas, 
	developed the formal inverse scattering theory of the 
	Intermediate Long Wave (ILW) equation and explored its connections with 
	the Benjamin-Ono (BO) and KdV equations. 
	The ILW equation
	\begin{align*}
		u_t + \frac{1}{\delta} u_x + 2 u u_x + Tu_{xx} = 0, 
	\end{align*}
	models the behavior of long internal gravitational waves in stratified fluids of 
	depth
	$0< \delta < \infty$, where $T$ is a singular operator which depends 
	on the depth $\delta$.
	In the limit 
	$\delta \to 0$, the ILW reduces to the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation, and in the 
	limit $\delta \to \infty$, the ILW (at least formally) reduces to the Benjamin-Ono (BO) 
	equation. 

	While the KdV
	equation is very well understood, a rigorous analysis of inverse scattering for the 
	ILW equation remains to be accomplished. There
	is currently no rigorous proof that the Inverse Scattering Transform
	outlined by Kodama \textit{et al.} solves the ILW, even for small data.
	In this dissertation, we seek to help ameliorate this gap in knowledge
	by presenting a mathematically rigorous construction
	of the direct scattering map for the ILW's Inverse Scattering Transform.

	To the University of Kentucky Graduate Student Congress, whose community of graduate students, 
	professional students and postdocs helped support me through graduate school.

\begin{acknowledgments}
	Throughout my graduate career, I benefited immensely from the care, support and 
	sage advice from a great many kind souls. In particular, I wish to thank my advisor, 
	Professor Peter Perry, and our collaborator from the University of Oklahoma for
	their patience and enthusiasm in sharing their great mathematical wisdom with me.
	I also wish to acknowledge my committee members, Professors Sumit Das, Lawrence 
	Harris, Peter Hislop, and Ribhu Kaul for their continual support throughout my 
	time at the University of Kentucky, and thank Professor Zhognwei Shen 
	for the many stimulating mathematical discussions.

	Reflecting on my time at the University of Kentucky, I find it hard to overstate 
	how much I benefited from my interactions from the math department's amazing 
	staff, Rejeana Cassady, Christine Levitt, and Sheri Rhine. I long ago lost 
	track of the number of times they each went out of their way to help and 
	support me, and they each had their own special ways to make me feel that 
	I could somehow make through the program at times when I felt less
	than optimistic about my future in the department. Rejeana, Christine, Sheri,
	Thank you.

	Few, I think, will dispute that graduate school is, in the best circumstances,
	a trying experience. I simply cannot imagine how I would have made it through
	graduate school without the support I recieved from numerious members of the 
	University of Kentucky Graduate Student Congress and members of the broader 
	University of Kentucky community. 

	\textbf{To be acknowledged:} {\color{red} Dr. Nandita Sahajpal, 
	Hilbert, Fiona, Dr. Morris Grubbs, $\ldots$}
